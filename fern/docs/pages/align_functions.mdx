title: Aligning Functions
description: Here you'll find information to help you align your functions to fit your requirements.

The way how to align the LLM with how you want them to carry out the functions in Tanuki is through demonstrative examples.

In classic [test-driven development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), the standard practice is to write a failing test before writing the code that makes it pass. 

Test-Driven Alignment (TDA) adapts this concept to align the behavior of a patched function with an expectation defined by a test.

To align the behaviour of your patched function to your needs, decorate a function with `@align` and assert the outputs of the function with the ‘assert’ statement as is done with standard tests.

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
  ```bash

  @tanuki.patch
  def classify_sentiment(input: str) -> Literal['Good', 'Bad']:
        """
        Classify the sentiment of the input text
        """
  
  @tanuki.align 
  def align_classify_sentiment(): 
      assert classify_sentiment("I love this!") == 'Good' 
      assert classify_sentiment("I hate this.") == 'Bad'
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Typescript">
  ```bash
  TBD
  ```
  </CodeBlock>

</CodeBlocks>


By writing a test that encapsulates the expected behaviour of the tanuki-patched function, you declare the contract that the function must fulfill. This enables you to:

1. **Verify Expectations:** Confirm that the function adheres to the desired output. 
2. **Capture Behavioural Nuances:** Make sure that the LLM respects the edge cases and nuances stipulated by your test.
3. **Develop Iteratively:** Refine and update the behavior of the tanuki-patched function by declaring the desired behaviour as tests.

TDA offers a lean yet robust methodology for grafting machine learning onto existing or new Python codebases. It combines the preventive virtues of TDD while addressing the specific challenges posed by the dynamism of LLMs. The align statements existence and the form they take are sufficient for LLMs to align themselves with the expected behavior.

## Examples of Aligning Functions

Aligning the stock winners function, to show we want the full company names not their symbols. 

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
  ```bash
  from typing import List
  @tanuki.patch
  def extract_stock_winners(input: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Below you will find an article with stocks analysis. Bring out the stock symbols of companies who are expected to go up or have positive sentiment
    """
  @tanuki.align
  def align_stocks():
      """We can test the function as normal using Pytest or Unittest"""

      input_1 = "A pair of earnings reports early Wednesday didn't do much to resolve the debate, as household products giant Procter & Gamble (PG 0.13%) saw its stock rise, not as fast though as recreational vehicle manufacturer Winnebago Industries (WGO 0.58%)"
      assert extract_stock_winners_good(input_1) == ['Procter & Gamble', 'Winnebago Industries']
  
  input_str = "Three dividend stocks that can be excellent investments to include as part of your retirement plan now are UnitedHealth Group (UNH -0.26%), Verizon Communications (VZ 0.83%), and ExxonMobil (XOM 1.31%)."
  
  # before aligning
  extract_stock_winners(input_str) # ['UNH', 'VZ', 'XOM']

  # after aligning
  align_stocks()
  extract_stock_winners(input_str) # ['UnitedHealth Group', 'Verizon Communications', 'ExxonMobil']
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Typescript">
  ```bash
  TBD
  ```
  </CodeBlock>

</CodeBlocks>


Aligning the sentiment classifier function, to calibrate the output scores. 

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
  ```bash
  @tanuki.patch
  def score_sentiment(input: str) -> Optional[Annotated[int, Field(gt=0, lt=10)]]:
      """Scores the input between 0-10, if it cant be scored, return None"""

  @tanuki.align
  def align_score_sentiment():
      """Register several examples to align your function"""

      assert score_sentiment("I love you") == 10
      assert score_sentiment("I hate you") == 0
      assert score_sentiment("You're okay I guess") == 5

  # before aligning
  score_sentiment("I like you") # 10
  

  # after aligning
  align_score_sentiment()
  score_sentiment("I like you") # 7
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Typescript">
  ```bash
  TBD
  ```
  </CodeBlock>

</CodeBlocks>

It is easy to also make complex align statements with pydantic objects. Here we will show how to align the urgency of the action items.

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
  ```bash
  @dataclass
  class ActionItem:
      goal: str = Field(description="What task must be completed")
      urgency: Literal['High', 'Medium', 'Low'] = Field(description="How urgent is the task")

  @tanuki.patch
  def action_items(input: str) -> List[ActionItem]:
      """Generate a list of Action Items"""
  
  @tanuki.align
  def align_action_items():
      """Register several examples to align your function"""

      assert action_items("We need to finish the project by the end of the week for work") == [ActionItem(goal="Finish the project", urgency="High")]
      assert action_items("I need to buy some more paper for the kitchen") == [ActionItem(goal="Buy more paper", urgency="Low")]
      assert action_items("I need to respond to the email I got from the landlord") == [ActionItem(goal="Respond to landlord email", urgency="Medium")]
  
  # before aligning
  input_str = "I need to book the hotel later today"
  action_items(input_str) # [ActionItem(goal="Book the hotel", urgency="High")]

  # after aligning
  align_action_items()
  action_items(input_str) # [ActionItem(goal="Book the hotel", urgency="Medium")]
  
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Typescript">
  ```bash
  TBD
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
