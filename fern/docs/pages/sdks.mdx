description: We offer Tanuki client libraries/SDKs in Python and Typescript
---

We provide official open-source SDKs (client libraries) for Typescript and Python.

We regularly update our SDKs, and adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (semver) principles, so we won't make breaking changes in minor or patch releases.

Both SDKs are implemented in lock-step, so both clients have the same features and functionality in with the same major and minor version numbers.
