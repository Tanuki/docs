Tanuki is a framework for developing powerful LLM applications without prompt engineering.

## Features
- Integrate in less than 5 minutes
- Optimize cost and latency by up to 90% through automatic distillation
- Align LLM behavior to your specifications declaratively
- Strongly Typed and validated input and outputs
- Supports leading LLM providers such as OpenAI, Bedrock, and more
- Open-source SDKs in Python and Typescript

## Principles

Tanuki is designed to help you build LLM applications using software engineering best practices.

It is built on the following principles:
- **Ergonomic**: Use idiomatic patterns and best practices in your language of choice for cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **Logic as Code**: Define your LLM features as typed functions, rather than prompt engineering.
- **Test-Driven**: Declare the behavior of your LLM functions with unit-tests.
- **Convention over Configuration**: Tanuki is designed to work out of the box with sensible defaults, but is also highly configurable.
- **Open Source**: Tanuki is open-source and community-driven.

## When to use Tanuki

- You are building features that require reasoning, understanding, or decision-making over complex or unstructured data.
- You need lower latency without sacrificing accuracy or cost.
- You want to align LLM behavior to your specifications declaratively.
- You want to use outputs from an LLM in the rest of your application.
