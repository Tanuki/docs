title: Patching Functions
description: Here you'll find information to get started quickly using Tanuki.

A core concept of Tanuki is the idea of a `patch` function.

A `patch` function is defined by a signature that represents a task or feature that will be executed by an LLM.

A signature includes a function name, typed input parameters, expected output, and a docstring that describes the task.

<CodeBlocks>
    <CodeBlock title="Python">
    ```python
    @tanuki.patch
    def classify_sentiment(input: str) -> Literal['Good', 'Bad']:
        """
        Classify the sentiment of the input text
        """
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
    <CodeBlock title="Typescript">
    ```typescript
    type Sentiment = "Good" | "Bad";
    class SentimentClassifier {
        static classifySentiment: Sentiment  = patch< Sentiment, string>()
            `Classify input statmements`;
    }
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>

Specifying the output types of patched functions allows you to define what kind of data the patched function is allowed to return.

This guards against the verbose or inconsistent outputs of the LLMs that are trained to be as “helpful as possible”.

To set the allowed outputs, you have to specify the output typehint as is normally done in functions.

You can use base classes such as ints, strings, lists or Literals or create custom types in Pydantic to express very complex rules about what the patched function can return. These act as guard-rails for the model preventing a patched function breaking the code or downstream workflows, and means you can avoid having to write custom validation logic in your application. You can see a couple of examples below or go to the [Examples](placeholder_url) section to see some more input and output examples

## Some Examples of Patching Functions

We have brought out some examples of demonstartive functions with different types of outputs.

An example function with a list of strings as output

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
  ```bash
  from typing import List
  @tanuki.patch
  def extract_stock_winners(input: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Below you will find an article with stocks analysis. Bring out the stock symbols of companies who are expected to go up or have positive sentiment
    """

  input_str = "Three dividend stocks that can be excellent investments to include as part of your retirement plan now are UnitedHealth Group (UNH -0.26%), Verizon Communications (VZ 0.83%), and ExxonMobil (XOM 1.31%)."
  extract_stock_winners(input_str) # ['UNH', 'VZ', 'XOM']
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Typescript">
  ```bash
  TBD
  ```
  </CodeBlock>

</CodeBlocks>

An example function with a custom Pydantic class as output

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
  ```bash
  @dataclass
  class ActionItem:
      goal: str = Field(description="What task must be completed")
      deadline: datetime = Field(description="The date the goal needs to be achieved")

  @tanuki.patch
  def action_items(input: str) -> List[ActionItem]:
      """Generate a list of Action Items"""

  input_str = "I need to complete the report by 5pm today"
  action_items(input_str) # [ActionItem(goal="Complete the report", deadline=datetime(2021, 10, 10, 17, 0))]
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Typescript">
  ```bash
  TBD
  ```
  </CodeBlock>

</CodeBlocks>

You can also constrain the types of data that can pass through your patched function by declaring the potential outputs that the model can return and specifying the world where the program exists in.

For instance, you can add integer constraints to the outputs for Pydantic field values, and generics if you wish.

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
  ```bash
  @tanuki.patch
  def score_sentiment(input: str) -> Optional[Annotated[int, Field(gt=0, lt=10)]]:
      """Scores the input between 0-10, if it cant be scored, return None"""


  score_sentiment("I like you") # 7
  score_sentiment("Apples might be red") # None
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Typescript">
  ```bash
  TBD
  ```
  </CodeBlock>

</CodeBlocks>
